# Collect 'Em All

**Collect 'Em All** is a secondary quest in the game. Since there is no way (in-game) to check exactly which gwent cards you do and don't have, this is regarded as one of the hardest, non-combative quests in the game.

## Walkthrough

To complete it, you must collect every single card of each type; a total of **120 cards**, from the **199 available cards**. The other **79 cards** are duplicates.

### Gwent Decks

- **Northern Realms Gwent deck** (40 cards)
- **Nilfgaardian Empire Gwent deck** (41 cards)
- **Monsters Gwent deck** (44 cards)
- **Scoia'tael Gwent deck** (41 cards)
- **Gwent neutral cards** (29 cards)

## Missable Cards

Throughout the game, some cards are easily missed if a player chooses one action over another, skips a side quest, or simply does not explore. Here's a list of such cases:

## Journal Entry

> In his previous adventures, Geralt had gained fame as a master dice poker player. Yet having mastered all challengers in this arena, he had no choice but to find another in which to garner more laurels. He thus decided to take up gwent, and since he aimed to play at the highest levels, he felt he had to gather a complete collection of all the cards available – including some which could only be had by winning them off the best players around.

## Objectives

- Complete your collection of gwent cards.

## Trivia

- The name of the quest is a homage to Pokémon's catchphrase **"Gotta Catch 'Em All"**.

## Notes

- This quest does not require the collection of gwent cards added by the expansion packs.
