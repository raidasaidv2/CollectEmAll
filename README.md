# Collect 'Em All

**Collect 'Em All** is a secondary quest in the game. Since there is no way (in-game) to check exactly which gwent cards you do and don't have, this is regarded as one of the hardest, non-combative quests in the game.

## Walkthrough

To complete it, you must collect every single card of each type; a total of **120 cards**, from the **199 available cards**. The other **79 cards** are duplicates.

### Gwent Decks

- **Northern Realms Gwent deck** (40 cards)
- **Nilfgaardian Empire Gwent deck** (41 cards)
- **Monsters Gwent deck** (44 cards)
- **Scoia'tael Gwent deck** (41 cards)
- **Gwent neutral cards** (29 cards)

## Missable Cards

Throughout the game, some cards are easily missed if a player chooses one action over another, skips a side quest, or simply does not explore.
